Today, that vision stands as a reality: Al-Khair Institute of Technology (AIT).\nWith over 10 years of experience in the social sector, I have always been inspired by the raw talent and resilience of students who, despite hardships, achieve remarkable things. However, I have also witnessed many talented students put their dreams on hold due to financial struggles and lack of family support.\nAIT was born to change that. We aim to provide quick, effective, and high-quality digital skills training, ensuring that every student has an equal opportunity to succeed in the global digital workforce. The digital space is one of the few fields where background does not define success—skills do.\nThrough AIT, I dream of Pakistanis providing world-class digital services and one day becoming leaders in the global digital economy. This is just the beginning. Together, we will build futures, transform lives, and create lasting change. Welcome to AIT—where dreams meet opportunity.\nMohammad Saad Sheikh\nFounder & CEO, AIT"
